          Novacrypt is a registered 501(c)3 organization that strives to make
          STEM education accessible for all students. In the past years, we have
          conducted various research programs that have reached almost 10,000
          students. Our various projects have been featured on CNBC and many
          students under our umbrella have gone on to compete in STEM
          competitions, winning tens of thousands of dollars in prizes. We have
          currently shifted our focus away from research and we have brought on
          a new team to introduce STEM learning and opportunities to students.

        </h1>
        <p className="text-white">
          We aim to foster STEM learning and competition between our community.
          NovaCrypt will be piloting a competition series across various STEM
          disciplines. Every month, the student will receive a broad question in
          a STEM topic that can be approached from multiple disciplines. These
          fields will rotate often but they may include astrophysics, biology,
          computer science, physics, public health, etc. These problems will
          often revolve around real world scenarios for students to address.

          Our Program
        </h1>
        <p className="text-white">
          Every six weeks, every chapter will receive a problem/question which
          they will be tasked with trying to solve. Based on the number of
          students in the chapter, the chapter should form teams of around 3-5
          members. The teams will compete challenges around topics including
          subjects like astrophysics, biology, medicine, and other related STEM
          topics. At the beginning of the cycle, each chapter will receive a
          presentation in which they are given background information about the
          topic and more details about the field. They will also be given
          possible ideas about the direction the topic could head in.
          <br />
          <br />
          The following week students will have an opportunity to listen to an
          expert give their insight about the topic. Students will be able to
          participate and ask a variety of questions to the guest speaker about
          the current research in the field as well as their own possible
          insight into the topic.
          <br />
          <br />
          Week three will focus on an activity based around the topic, which the
          NovaCrypt team will provide to advisors.
          <br />
          <br />
          The next two weeks of club meetings are dedicated towards project
          workdays. Although the teams will be able to begin working before
          these two club meetings, the last two weeks of the month will be
          reserved towards the team finalizing their solutions for submission to
          NovaCrypt.
          <br />
          <br />
          Each month, the winning teams as well as the standouts will receive
          recognition in our newsletter. Specially recognized members may have
          opportunities at internships and other research opportunities in the
          future. Winning teams will receive scholarship money from our
          sponsors.
